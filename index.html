        <p>Hi there! My name is Jeric, I live in Roseville, CA. I studied Medical Laboratory Science for 4 years and got a degree out of it. <br><br>In 2013, I worked for my California Clinical Laboratory Science License to practice my profession and as of this time, I am currently working in a reference laboratory for the past 5 years. <br><br>I work with laboratory equipment to do testing and I deal with patient samples including but not limited to poo, pee and blood. For each test run, I review Quality Control materials used and verify test requests. The results I release aid the physician in the diagnosis and in the treatment of diseases. <br> <br>
        I am currently studying Web Development at UC Davis Extension Coding Bootcamp because I happen to be interested in the subject. It is all new to me and different from what I have or from what I have been doing. I am curious to know how things work and I want to challenge myself in learning Web Development.</p>
